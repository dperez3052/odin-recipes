# odin-recipes
This is my first project in my journey to become a web developer.  I will be using what I have learned so far in the HTML
section of the foundations course to build a webpage with 3 recipes using imagines, links, and lists.  I am looking forward
to the challenge and will update the README with any bumps or challenges I face along the way.
