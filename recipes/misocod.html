    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make Nobu's famous Miso Cod at home today! Also known as 
        Black Cod with Miso, this classic Japanese seafood dish is 
        delicate, buttery, and melt-in-your-mouth. You will be surprised 
        at how easy it is to pull this off at home.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 fillets sablefish (gindara) (about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick; you can also use salmon and sea bass)</li>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp sake (for cleaning and removing the odor of the fish)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>For the miso marinade</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 Tbsp Saikyo miso (Kyoto-style white miso)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp sake</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>To marinate the fish(two to three days before serving)</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle salt over the fish and set it aside for 30 minutes. The salt will draw out excess moisture and reduce the odor of the fish.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, add the saikyo miso, mirin, and sake (and sugar, if you are using regular white miso.)</li>
            <li>Mix it all together and pour the marinade into a flat-bottomed airtight container.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 Tbsp sake over the fish to rinse off the salt. Gently pat dry with a paper towel to remove the moisture.<strong>Do not wash the fish under running water.</strong></li>
            <li>Place the fish in the container and coat both sides of the fish with the marinade.</li>
            <li>Slather the fillets with the marinade. Cover the container and keep it in the refrigerator 
                for up to 2-3 days. If you prefer your fish less salty (and don't eat this dish with rice, for example), 
                you can reduce the marination time to 1 day (or even several hours.) It depends on your preference.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>To remove the fish from the marinade</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>With your fingers, wipe the marinade off the fish completely. Do not leave any excess marinade on the fish; otherwise, it will burn easily. At this point, you can individually wrap the fish with plastic wrap and store it in a freezer bag for up to 2-3 weeks. 
                Defrost in the refrigerator before cooking.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>To prepare the fish for cooking</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the fish skin side up on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper/silicone mat (for baking) or foil (for broiling).</li>
            </ol>
        <p><strong>To Bake</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200ºC) with a rack placed in the center of the oven. For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). 
                Bake the fish on the parchment paper until the surface is blistered and browned a bit, about 20 minutes. You do not need to flip the fish.</li>
        </ol>
